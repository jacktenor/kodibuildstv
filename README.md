by a newbie developer and may contain dead links and or bugs.

KodiBuildsTV is an Android TV app that allows you to download popular Kodi build repositories from a list.                                   
You can add the repositories to Kodi using "Install from zip file" and navigating to Download/kodibuildstv directory.                              
You should be able to build by adding the kodibuildstv directory to Android Studio as a project.                                         

I know very little about all this so if anyone can improve on this please do.
