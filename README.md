This repo is for personal use. Your welcome to checkout KodiBuildsTV but it is a work in progress 
by a complete begginer, and may contain dead links and or bugs.
Also there are possible security risks when using third party builds.                                  

KodiBuildsTV is an Android TV app that allows you to download popular Kodi build repositories from a list.                                          
You can add the repositories to Kodi using "Install from zip file" and navigating to your Download/kodibuildstv directory.                              

You should be able to build KodiBuildsTV.apk by using the command...                                          

git clone https://github.com/jacktenor/kodibuildstv                                                       

Then from the Android Studio welcome screen choose "Open an Existing Project".                                    
Navigate to and highlight the KodiBuildsTV directory that's within the kodibuildstv directory you cloned.                            
Click "ok" and after it's imported use the build menu to build it.                                           
I'm sure there's a better way but that worked for me.                                                 

I know very little about all this so if anyone can improve this please do.
